# BONUS-05: Front-end Spin-Wheel - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented a front-end spin wheel component for the daily bonus system.

## Completed Tasks:

### 1. Created SpinWheel Component ✅
- Built animated SVG wheel with 5 slices for ticket values [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
- Implemented smooth rotation animation using framer-motion
- Added visual feedback during spin (pointer wobble, status messages)
- Integrated canvas-confetti for celebration effects
- File: `/client/src/components/SpinWheel.tsx`

### 2. Created DailyBonusCard Wrapper Component ✅
- Fetches daily bonus data on mount using `/api/bonus/today`
- Shows SpinWheel for unrevealed bonuses
- Displays success state for already revealed bonuses
- Handles both child self-view and parent viewing child scenarios
- File: `/client/src/components/DailyBonusCard.tsx`

### 3. Integrated API Calls ✅
- SpinWheel calls POST `/api/bonus/spin` when user clicks spin
- Handles success/error states appropriately
- Updates local state after successful spin
- Triggers parent callback for data refresh

### 4. Wired into Dashboard ✅
- Added DailyBonusCard to child dashboard section
- Positioned between Savings Progress and Chores sections
- Added refresh callbacks to update balance and stats
- File: `/client/src/pages/new-dashboard.tsx` (line 659-668)

### 5. Applied Styling Polish ✅
- Enhanced both components with Tailwind CSS
- Added dark mode support throughout
- Implemented gradients, shadows, and hover effects
- Made responsive for mobile devices
- Added custom animations (animate-ping-slow, shadow-glow)

### 6. Created Unit Tests ✅
- Comprehensive test suite for SpinWheel component
- Tests rendering, user interactions, API calls, and error handling
- File: `/client/src/components/__tests__/SpinWheel.test.tsx`

## Technical Implementation Details:

### SpinWheel Component Props:
```typescript
interface SpinWheelProps {
  bonus: DailyBonusSimple;
  onSpinComplete?: (result: any) => void;
}
```

### DailyBonusCard Component Props:
```typescript
interface DailyBonusCardProps {
  userId?: number;
  onBonusSpun?: () => void;
}
```

### Key Features:
- Real-time spinning animation with customizable speed
- Sound effects integration (wheelspin and celebration)
- Confetti celebration on successful spin
- Error handling with user feedback
- Automatic result display after spin

## Integration Points:
- Uses existing `/api/bonus/today` and `/api/bonus/spin` endpoints
- Integrates with auth store for user context
- Updates stats through React Query invalidation
- Maintains consistency with existing UI patterns

## Next Steps (if needed):
- Could add more animation variations
- Could implement streak tracking
- Could add daily bonus history view
- Could enhance mobile gestures for spinning
