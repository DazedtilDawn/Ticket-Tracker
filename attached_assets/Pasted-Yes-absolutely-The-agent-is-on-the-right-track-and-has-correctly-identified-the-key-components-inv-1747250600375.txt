Yes, absolutely! The agent is on the right track and has correctly identified the key components involved in the "Bonus Wheel Not Triggering Correctly" issue.

**The agent should definitely continue investigating and fix the specific issue with the bonus wheel triggering mechanism.**

Based on the agent's own analysis:

*   "The `/api/earn` endpoint correctly identifies when a bonus chore is completed (line 812-814)"
*   "It properly sets `bonusTriggered = true` and records the `dailyBonusId` (lines 823-824)"
*   "The response includes this information (lines 871-881)"
*   "However, in the `ChoreCard` component: `handleComplete` properly calls `onComplete` to complete the chore (line 43). It should also check for `bonus_triggered` in the response from `/api/earn` but it's **only checking `is_daily_bonus`** (line 48)" (This `is_daily_bonus` is likely a prop on the chore object itself, not the dynamic flag from the API response indicating a *trigger*).

**This last point is the likely smoking gun for why the modal isn't appearing.**

**Specific Instructions for the Agent to Fix This:**

**"Agent, you've pinpointed a likely cause for the bonus wheel not triggering: `ChoreCard.tsx` seems to be checking a static `chore.is_daily_bonus` prop instead of the dynamic `response.bonus_triggered` flag from the `/api/earn` call.**

**Please implement the following fixes:**

1.  **Modify `ChoreCard.tsx`:**
    *   The `handleComplete` function in `ChoreCard.tsx` calls `await onComplete(chore.id)`. The `onComplete` prop is a function passed down from the parent page (`Dashboard.tsx` or `Chores.tsx`).
    *   The `onComplete` function in the parent page is the one that actually makes the API call to `/api/earn` and receives the response containing `bonus_triggered` and `daily_bonus_id`.
    *   Therefore, `ChoreCard.tsx` itself *should not* be trying to decide if a bonus is triggered from its own props after `onComplete` finishes.
    *   **Remove any logic from `ChoreCard.tsx` that attempts to open the `SpinPromptModal` or handle `bonus_triggered` directly.** The `ChoreCard`'s responsibility is just to call `onComplete`.

2.  **Modify Parent Page(s) - `Dashboard.tsx` and `Chores.tsx` (where `handleChoreComplete` is defined):**
    *   The `handleChoreComplete` function (or whatever function is passed as `onComplete` to `ChoreCard`) is where the API call to `/api/earn` is made.
    *   **After a successful response from `/api/earn`:**
        *   Check `if (response.bonus_triggered === true && response.daily_bonus_id != null)`.
        *   If true, then set the state variables that control the `SpinPromptModal`:
            ```typescript
            // In Dashboard.tsx / Chores.tsx
            // const [isSpinPromptOpen, setIsSpinPromptOpen] = useState(false);
            // const [dailyBonusIdForSpin, setDailyBonusIdForSpin] = useState<number | null>(null);
            // const [choreNameForSpinModal, setChoreNameForSpinModal] = useState("");

            // Inside the successful part of handleChoreComplete / onComplete:
            if (response.bonus_triggered && response.daily_bonus_id) {
              setChoreNameForSpinModal(response.chore.name); // Assuming API response includes chore details
              setDailyBonusIdForSpin(response.daily_bonus_id);
              setIsSpinPromptOpen(true);
            }
            ```
    *   Ensure `SpinPromptModal` is correctly rendered in the JSX of `Dashboard.tsx` and `Chores.tsx` and its `isOpen`, `onClose`, `onSpin`, `choreName`, `dailyBonusId` props are correctly wired up.

**Acceptance Criteria for this fix:**
*   When a parent marks a child's *designated daily bonus chore* as complete:
    *   The `/api/earn` endpoint awards base tickets and returns `{ ..., bonus_triggered: true, daily_bonus_id: <ID>, chore: { name: "..." } }`.
    *   The client-side `handleChoreComplete` function in `Dashboard.tsx` (or `Chores.tsx`) receives this response.
    *   The `SpinPromptModal` appears, displaying the correct chore name.
    *   The correct `daily_bonus_id` is stored in state, ready to be passed to the `/api/bonus-spin` call when the child clicks "Spin Now!" in the modal.
*   Completing a *non-bonus* chore does *not* trigger the `SpinPromptModal`.

This focused fix should directly address the bonus wheel triggering issue. After this is confirmed working, the agent can proceed to the "Parental Bonus Management UI - Displaying Assignments" task.
