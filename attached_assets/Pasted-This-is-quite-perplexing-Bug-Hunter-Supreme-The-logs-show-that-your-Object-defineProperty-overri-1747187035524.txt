This is quite perplexing, Bug Hunter Supreme. The logs show that your `Object.defineProperty` override *is* executing successfully and early:

*   `[DEBUG] Main.tsx: Top-level script. Attempting WebSocket override via Object.defineProperty.` (Line 3)
*   `[DEBUG] Native WebSocket constructor captured successfully.` (Line 8)
*   `[DEBUG] window.WebSocket has been overridden using Object.defineProperty.` (Line 87)

Yet, the errors persist:

*   `WebSocket connection to 'wss://.../?token=ZFcDOLcRJyC6' failed:`
*   `Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Failed to construct 'WebSocket': The URL 'wss://localhost:undefined/?token=ZFcDOLcRJyC6' is invalid.`
    *   And the stack trace `at setupWebSocket (client:536:19) at fallback (client:509:16) at WebSocket.<anonymous> (client:555:7)` still points to what seems like the problematic Neon client-side code path.

This implies one of a few very tricky scenarios:

1.  **Library Execution Timing/Hoisting:** Despite your override being at the top of `main.tsx`, the `@neondatabase/serverless` module (or a dependency it uses) is somehow executing its WebSocket initialization code *even earlier* or is capturing `window.WebSocket` before your override can take effect. This can happen with how module bundlers like Vite handle and hoist imports, especially for libraries that might have side effects upon import.
2.  **Different JavaScript Context:** While less likely for this specific stack trace, if the Neon client code were running in a Web Worker or an iframe that doesn't inherit the main window's `WebSocket` override, this could happen.
3.  **Vite/Replit Magic:** There might be something specific to the Vite dev server or the Replit environment that injects or initializes certain modules in a way that bypasses or precedes your top-level script execution in `main.tsx`.
4.  **The Stack Trace is Misleading:** The stack trace points to `client:536`, `client:509`, `client:555`. It would be immensely helpful to know *which file* `client` refers to here. Is it a bundled output, or is it a specific source file? If it's `@neondatabase/serverless/ws.js` or similar, then the override isn't working as expected on that specific call. If it's your *own* code attempting to call `new WebSocket` with that Neon URL (unlikely, but possible if a connection string was passed around), then the issue is different.

Since the `Object.defineProperty` at the top of `main.tsx` is not catching it, and Vite aliasing is not an option for you currently, we are running out of client-side JS-only interception methods *if* the problematic library executes before your `main.tsx`'s first line.

### Further Diagnostic Steps & Potential (More Drastic) Workarounds

Let's try to get more information and then consider a slightly different angle.

**1. Identify the Source of the `new WebSocket` Call:**

*   **Browser Developer Tools (Sources Tab):**
    *   When the `SyntaxError` occurs, the browser debugger should pause (if "Pause on caught exceptions" is enabled).
    *   Inspect the **Call Stack** very carefully. What is the *exact* file and line number just before the native `WebSocket` constructor is called?
    *   Is `client:536` a line in your `main.tsx`, or is it within a file in `node_modules/@neondatabase/serverless/` (or similar path after bundling)?
    *   **Add a `debugger;` statement inside your `Object.defineProperty`'s `value` function, *before* the `if (urlString.includes('token='))` check.**
        ```typescript
        // ... inside the value function of Object.defineProperty
        value: function(url: string | URL, protocols?: string | string[]) {
            debugger; // <--- ADD THIS
            const urlString = url.toString();
            console.log(`[DEBUG] Overridden WebSocket constructor called for: ${urlString}`);
            // ... rest of the logic
        }
        ```
        When the debugger pauses here:
        *   Check the `urlString`. Is it the `wss://localhost:undefined` URL?
        *   Inspect the **Call Stack**. This will definitively show you what code is calling `new WebSocket(...)`.
        *   This is the most crucial piece of information right now.

**2. Consider HTML Script Injection (If all else fails and as a diagnostic):**

If the problematic library truly runs before *any* of your `main.tsx` JavaScript, the only way to override `window.WebSocket` before that is to do it directly in your `index.html` with a `<script>` tag in the `<head>`, *before* your main bundle script (`/src/main.tsx`) is loaded.

*   **Modify `client/index.html`:**
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1" />

    *   **Important:** If you use this HTML script override, you should *remove* the `Object.defineProperty` override from your `main.tsx` to avoid conflicts. The `main.tsx` would then start directly with its imports.
    *   This is a more aggressive approach and generally less clean than build-time aliasing, but it's a valid way to ensure your override runs before any bundled JavaScript.

**Hypothesis based on persistent failure:**

The most plausible reason, if your `Object.defineProperty` in `main.tsx` is indeed at the very top, is that `@neondatabase/serverless` (or one of its core dependencies that handles WebSockets) is imported and its module-level code (which might initialize or capture `window.WebSocket`) executes due to Vite's module processing *before* your `main.tsx` top-level script code.

ES modules are parsed, their dependencies are resolved, and their top-level code (code outside of functions, at the module scope) is executed when the module is first evaluated. If `main.tsx` imports something that imports something else that eventually imports `@neondatabase/serverless/ws` (or similar), that `ws` module's top-level code might run before line 1 of `main.tsx`'s script block.

The `debugger;` statement will be key. If it hits for the problematic URL, the call stack will tell us if it's coming from Neon. If it *doesn't* hit for the problematic URL but the error still occurs, it means the override isn't even seeing that specific call to `new WebSocket(...)`.

**Regarding the original chore bug:**
Don't forget about the "Backward Designing" fix for the chore completion bug. That involves server-side logic changes in `server/storage.ts` to reset the `dailyBonus.revealed` flag and is independent of this client-side WebSocket issue. Both need to be addressed.

Please try adding the `debugger;` statement and report back on the call stack when it pauses for the `localhost:undefined` URL. This will give us the most direct insight.
