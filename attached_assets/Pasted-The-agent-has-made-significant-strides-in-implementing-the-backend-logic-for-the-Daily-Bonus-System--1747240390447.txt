The agent has made significant strides in implementing the backend logic for the Daily Bonus System, particularly the "First Parent Login" trigger for bonus assignment and updating the `/api/earn` endpoint. This is excellent progress for Sprint 1!

Let's conduct a meticulous review of the reported changes and the conceptual implementation.

### Sprint 1: Daily Bonus System - Backend Progress Review (Agent's Update)

**Agent's Reported Progress:**

1.  **✓ Created `DailyBonusAssignmentMiddleware.ts` that runs for authenticated parent users.**
2.  **✓ Enhanced login route (`POST /api/auth/login`) to automatically trigger bonus assignments.** (This seems to be where the middleware/logic is now invoked).
3.  **✓ Updated `/api/earn` endpoint to detect bonus chores and trigger wheel spins (i.e., return `bonus_triggered: true` and `daily_bonus_id`).**
4.  **✓ Added proper error handling and logging.**

**Key Logic Points from Agent's Description:**

*   On parent login, system checks if daily bonuses assigned for each child.
*   If not, uses `storage.assignDailyBonusChore()` (which should respect cooldowns and select random eligible chore).
*   Assignment happens once per day per child.
*   Completing assigned bonus chore flags for wheel spin.

### Detailed Assessment & Areas for Verification:

1.  **Daily Bonus Assignment Trigger (on Parent Login):**
    *   **Implementation Choice:** The agent chose to enhance the `/api/auth/login` route directly to handle this, rather than a separate Express middleware applied to multiple parent routes.
        *   **Pro:** Ensures assignment happens at a very specific, early point in a parent's session.
        *   **Con:** If a parent is already logged in (e.g., token still valid from previous day) and doesn't explicitly "log in" again but just visits the app, the bonus assignment might not trigger until their next explicit login. The "first authenticated API call of the day by a parent" approach via a broader middleware might be more robust for this scenario.
        *   **For v1, triggering on explicit login is an acceptable starting point.** We can refine if needed.
    *   **Code to Review (`server/routes.ts` - `/api/auth/login` handler):**
        ```typescript
        // Conceptual structure - actual code not fully shown by agent
        app.post("/api/auth/login", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
          // ... (existing login logic: validate credentials, get user, create JWT) ...
          const user = await storage.getUserByUsername(credentials.username);
          if (user && user.role === 'parent') {
            const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
            const children = await storage.getUsersByRole('child'); // Assumes this exists
            for (const child of children) {
              const existingBonus = await storage.getDailyBonus(today, child.id);
              if (!existingBonus) {
                await storage.assignDailyBonusChore(child.id, today);
                 // Log: console.log(`Assigned daily bonus to ${child.name} for ${today}`);
              }
            }
          }
          // ... (return login response with token and user) ...
        });
        ```
    *   **Verification Needed:**
        *   Confirm `storage.getUsersByRole('child')` was implemented in `server/storage.ts`.
        *   Confirm `storage.assignDailyBonusChore(child_id, date)` correctly handles random selection, cooldown via `chores.last_bonus_assigned`, and DB record creation in `dailyBonus` table.
        *   Test: Parent logs in for the first time on a new day. Check `dailyBonus` table: are records created for Bryce and Kiki with `trigger_type: 'chore_completion'`, `is_spun: false`, and a valid `assigned_chore_id`? Is `chores.last_bonus_assigned` updated for the selected chores?
        *   Test: Parent logs out and logs back in on the *same* day. Ensure new bonus chores are *not* reassigned (idempotency).

2.  **Updated `/api/earn` Endpoint:**
    *   **Agent's Action:** "Updated `/api/earn` endpoint to detect bonus chores and trigger wheel spins" and "Updated `/api/earn` endpoint to work with the new `dailyBonus` schema."
    *   **Code to Review (`server/routes.ts` - `/api/earn` handler, particularly the SQL fix part):**
        The agent mentioned fixing an SQL query error. The crucial part is how it checks for the bonus:
        ```typescript
        // Conceptual structure in /api/earn
        // ... (after validating chore_id and user) ...
        const chore = await storage.getChore(chore_id);
        // ... (check if alreadyCompleted) ...

        const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
        const dailyBonusRecord = await storage.getDailyBonus(today, user.id); // user is the child who completed
        let bonus_triggered = false;
        let daily_bonus_id_for_spin: number | null = null;
        let actual_bonus_tickets_from_spin = 0; // This comes from /api/bonus-spin, not here

        if (dailyBonusRecord && dailyBonusRecord.assigned_chore_id === chore_id && !dailyBonusRecord.is_spun) {
          bonus_triggered = true;
          daily_bonus_id_for_spin = dailyBonusRecord.id;
          // DO NOT set dailyBonusRecord.revealed = true here. That's handled by the spin endpoint.
          // The /api/earn endpoint awards BASE tickets for the chore.
          // The /api/bonus-spin endpoint awards ADDITIONAL bonus tickets.
        }

        const base_tickets_earned = chore.tickets;
        // Transaction for BASE tickets
        const transaction = await storage.createTransaction({
          user_id: user.id,
          chore_id,
          delta_tickets: base_tickets_earned,
          type: "earn",
          note: `Completed: ${chore.name}`,
          source: 'chore' // Ensure correct source
        });

        const response = {
          transaction,
          chore,
          balance: await storage.getUserBalance(user.id),
          activeGoal: await storage.getActiveGoalByUser(user.id), // Simplified
          bonus_triggered: bonus_triggered,
          daily_bonus_id: daily_bonus_id_for_spin, // For client to know which bonus to spin
          // boostPercent: calculateBoostPercent(...) // If still used
        };
        
        // Broadcast "transaction:earn" - payload should be carefully constructed
        broadcast("transaction:earn", { /* ... relevant data ... */ });
        return res.status(201).json(response);
        ```
    *   **Verification Needed:**
        *   Test: Child completes a *non-bonus* chore. Ensure `response.bonus_triggered` is `false`.
        *   Test: Child completes their *assigned daily bonus chore* (and `is_spun` is `false`). Ensure `response.bonus_triggered` is `true` and `response.daily_bonus_id` is correct.
        *   Ensure only base tickets for the chore are awarded by `/api/earn`. Bonus tickets come *later* from the `/api/bonus-spin` call.

3.  **Error Handling & Logging:**
    *   **Agent:** "Added proper error handling and logging throughout."
    *   **Verification:** This is ongoing. As we test, we'll see if logs are sufficient and errors are handled gracefully.

### Sprint 1 Backend - Remaining Key Tasks (Before Heavy Frontend on Bonus Wheel):

Even with this great progress, the following backend pieces from our Sprint 1 plan are still crucial and don't seem explicitly covered by the agent's latest update:

1.  **API: Parent Override for Bonus Chore:**
    *   `GET /api/daily-bonus/assignments?date=YYYY-MM-DD` (Parent: view/override bonus chore assignments).
    *   `PUT /api/daily-bonus/assign` (Parent: override assigned bonus chore).
2.  **API & Logic: `/api/bonus-spin` (Weighted RNG, Transaction for Bonus Tickets, `dailyBonus` Update):**
    *   This is the core of the wheel interaction. The agent mentioned updating `/api/spin-wheel` (likely this endpoint) to "work with the new schema," but the full logic (weighted draw, "Double Base" cap, "Spin Again" max 1, creating the *bonus-only* transaction, updating `dailyBonus.is_spun` and `dailyBonus.spin_result_tickets`) needs to be implemented and tested.
3.  **API: Good Behavior Spin Trigger:**
    *   Logic in `POST /api/behavior-tickets` (or similar) to create a `dailyBonus` record with `trigger_type: 'good_behavior_reward'` when a parent awards a spin.

---

### Recommendation for Next Steps:

The agent has laid excellent groundwork for daily bonus *assignment* and flagging a chore *completion* as bonus-eligible.

**Next Task for Agent (Focus on completing the bonus *interaction* loop):**

**"Agent, fantastic progress on the daily bonus assignment and the `/api/earn` endpoint modifications!**

**Now, please focus on implementing the backend logic for the actual bonus spin interaction:**

1.  **Implement the `POST /api/bonus-spin` endpoint (this might be an update to the existing `/api/spin-wheel` route based on your previous work):**
    *   **Input:** Expects `{ daily_bonus_id: number }`.
    *   **Authentication:** Ensure only the child to whom the `daily_bonus_id` belongs (or a parent) can initiate the spin.
    *   **Validation:**
        *   Verify the `dailyBonus` record exists for the given `daily_bonus_id`.
        *   Verify `dailyBonus.is_spun` is currently `false`. If `true`, return an error (e.g., "Bonus already spun for today/this instance").
    *   **Spin Logic (Server-Side):**
        *   Perform a weighted random draw based on the defined `WHEEL_SEGMENTS` (from `client/src/components/daily-bonus-wheel.tsx` or a shared config) and their probabilities (e.g., +1: 25%, +2: 22%, etc.).
        *   Handle the "Double Base Tickets" outcome:
            *   If `dailyBonus.trigger_type` was `'chore_completion'`, fetch `base_tickets` from `chores` table using `dailyBonus.assigned_chore_id`.
            *   Calculate `bonus_amount = original_chore.base_tickets` (effectively doubling, as `/api/earn` already gave one set). Apply the 10-ticket hard cap to this *additional amount* if "Double Base" means "add base again, up to 10 extra."
            *   If `dailyBonus.trigger_type` was `'good_behavior_reward'`, "Double Base" might award a default medium prize (e.g., 5 tickets), as there's no "base chore" to double.
        *   Handle "Spin Again" outcome:
            *   Award 0 tickets for *this* spin.
            *   The response should indicate `respin_allowed: true`. The client will then re-enable the spin button. The *next* call to `/api/bonus-spin` for the *same* `daily_bonus_id` should NOT allow another respin (treat subsequent "Spin Again" as +1 ticket). This requires the `spin_wheel` algorithm in the agent's Python stub to handle an `allow_respin` flag.
        *   For fixed ticket amounts, `bonus_amount = segment_value`.
    *   **Database Updates (within a DB transaction for atomicity):**
        *   Create a new transaction record:
            *   `user_id`: from `dailyBonus.user_id`
            *   `delta_tickets`: `bonus_amount` calculated above.
            *   `source`: `'bonus_spin'`
            *   `ref_id`: `daily_bonus_id`
            *   `reason`: e.g., "Bonus Wheel Spin: +X tickets" or "Bonus Wheel: Double Base!"
        *   Update the `dailyBonus` record:
            *   `is_spun = true`
            *   `spin_result_tickets = bonus_amount`
    *   **API Response:** Return the outcome, e.g., `{ "segment_label": "+5 Tickets", "tickets_awarded_this_spin": 5, "new_child_balance": Y, "respin_allowed": false }`.
    *   **WebSocket Broadcast:** Send a `balance_update` and potentially a `bonus_spun_update` event.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   `/api/bonus-spin` correctly processes a spin request for a valid, unspun `daily_bonus_id`.
*   Weighted RNG selects a wheel segment.
*   "Double Base Tickets" (with cap) and "Spin Again" (max 1) outcomes are handled correctly.
*   A new transaction for *only the bonus tickets* is created.
*   `dailyBonus` table is updated correctly.
*   The API response provides clear information about the spin outcome.
*   Appropriate error handling for invalid requests (e.g., already spun, invalid ID).
*   Unit tests cover different spin outcomes and edge cases."

This will complete the core server-side loop for bonus chores. After this, implementing the parent override APIs (`GET /daily-bonus/assignments` and `PUT /daily-bonus/assign`) would be the next logical backend step before significant frontend work on the wheel UI.
