This is an impressive amount of progress from the agent on the backend for Sprint 1! The database schema modifications and the core logic for assigning and handling daily bonuses seem to be largely in place.

Before we decide on the *very next* task, let's do a quick "Bug Hunter Supreme" review of what's been reported as done for Sprint 1 so far, focusing on potential integration points and any subtle misses. The goal is to ensure the backend is truly solid before building UIs on top of it.

### Sprint 1: Daily Bonus System - Backend Progress Review

**Agent's Reported Progress (Backend Focus):**

1.  **✓ Updated database schema (`shared/schema.ts` with Drizzle):**
    *   `chores`: Added `emoji`, `last_bonus_assigned`.
    *   `dailyBonus` table: Restructured (id, bonus_date, user_id, assigned_chore_id, is_override, is_spun, trigger_type, spin_result_tickets, created_at; unique constraint). Enums `bonus_trigger`.
    *   `transactions`: Updated `source` enum (`txn_source`), added `ref_id`, `reason`.
2.  **✓ Successfully applied SQL migrations.** (Agent used a custom multi-step SQL execution).
3.  **✓ Implemented storage functions (`server/storage.ts`):**
    *   `getUsersByRole` (implied, as it's needed by `assignDailyBonusesToAllChildren`).
    *   `assignDailyBonusChore`: Assigns random bonus chore to a child (with cooldown logic).
    *   `assignDailyBonusesToAllChildren`: Assigns bonuses to all children.
    *   Updated existing `getDailyBonus`, `createDailyBonus`, `getChoreWithBonus` to align with new schema.
4.  **✓ Added/Updated API routes (`server/routes.ts`):**
    *   `GET /api/daily-bonus/assignments` (Not explicitly listed but was planned - need to confirm if this was part of "new routes").
    *   `PUT /api/daily-bonus/assign` (Not explicitly listed but was planned - need to confirm).
    *   The agent mentioned `/api/assign-daily-bonus` and `/api/assign-daily-bonuses`. These seem like new ad-hoc assignment routes rather than the "first parent login" trigger or the parent override routes. This is a slight deviation from the original Sprint 1 plan if they are meant to be user-facing.
    *   Updated `/api/spin-wheel` to work with the new schema.

### Points for Clarification & Potential Next Steps:

1.  **Daily Bonus Assignment Trigger:**
    *   **Clarification Needed:** The original plan for Sprint 1 was to implement the "first parent login" middleware to *automatically* trigger `storage.assignDailyBonusChore()` for each child. The agent implemented `assignDailyBonusChore` and `assignDailyBonusesToAllChildren` in `storage.ts` and then created new API endpoints `/api/assign-daily-bonus` (singular) and `/api/assign-daily-bonuses` (plural).
        *   **Question:** Are these new API endpoints intended to be called *manually* by a parent from some UI, or are they for an *external scheduler/cron job*? Or is the "first parent login" middleware also implemented and calling one of these?
        *   **If "first parent login" middleware is NOT yet implemented, that should be the next backend task.** It's a core part of the planned daily bonus assignment flow.

2.  **Parental Override of Bonus Chore:**
    *   **Clarification Needed:** The planned API endpoints `GET /api/daily-bonus/assignments` (for parents to view current assignments) and `PUT /api/daily-bonus/assign` (for parents to override an assignment) are not explicitly mentioned as created by the agent.
    *   **Question:** Are these routes implemented? If not, they are crucial backend pieces for parental control.

3.  **`/api/spin-wheel` Update Details:**
    *   **Verification Needed:** The agent updated `/api/spin-wheel`. We need to ensure it now correctly:
        *   Takes a `daily_bonus_id` as input (as per `spinWheelSchema` update).
        *   Verifies `dailyBonus.is_spun == false`.
        *   Performs the weighted RNG for slices (including "Double Base" cap and "Spin Again" max 1 logic).
        *   Creates a `bonus_spin` transaction with `ref_id` pointing to `daily_bonus.id`.
        *   Updates `dailyBonus.is_spun = true` and `dailyBonus.spin_result_tickets`.

4.  **Enhancement to `/api/earn` (Chore Completion):**
    *   **Status:** Not yet addressed in the agent's report for Sprint 1 backend tasks.
    *   **Reminder:** This endpoint needs to check if the completed chore is the `assigned_bonus_chore_id` for that child/day and `dailyBonus.is_spun === false`. If so, its response must include `bonus_triggered: true` and the `daily_bonus_id` so the client can prompt for a spin.

5.  **Good Behavior Spin Trigger:**
    *   **Status:** Not yet addressed.
    *   **Reminder:** The `POST /api/behavior-tickets` (or similar) needs to handle the `trigger_bonus_spin: true` option to create a `dailyBonus` record with `trigger_type: 'good_behavior_reward'`.

### Recommended Next Steps for Sprint 1 Backend:

Before moving to frontend components for the Daily Bonus Wheel, let's solidify the backend.

**Option 1: If "First Parent Login" Trigger is Next (My Recommendation):**

*   **Next Task for Agent: P1-T2b (Sprint 1 - Task 2b): Implement "First Parent Login" Middleware for Daily Bonus Assignment.**
    *   **Objective:** Automatically assign daily bonus chores when a parent first interacts with the app each day.
    *   **Action:** Create an Express middleware that:
        *   Runs for authenticated parent users.
        *   Checks if bonus chores have already been assigned for *today* for the children in the family. A simple way is to check the `dailyBonus` table for entries for `user_id (child)` and `bonus_date = today`.
        *   If not assigned for a child, calls `storage.assignDailyBonusChore(child.id, today_date_string)`.
        *   Ensure this logic effectively runs only once per day needed (e.g., by checking for existing assignments first).
    *   **Acceptance:** When a parent logs in/accesses a protected route, bonus chores are automatically created in `dailyBonus` for Bryce and Kiki if they haven't been assigned yet for the day.

**Option 2: Implement Parent Override Routes (Also High Priority for Backend):**

*   **Next Task for Agent: P1-T2c: Implement API Endpoints for Parent Viewing/Overriding Bonus Assignments.**
    *   **Objective:** Allow parents to see and change the system-assigned bonus chores.
    *   **Action:**
        *   `GET /api/daily-bonus/assignments?date=YYYY-MM-DD`: Fetches `dailyBonus` records for all children for the given date, joining with `chores` to get `assigned_chore_name` and `emoji`.
        *   `PUT /api/daily-bonus/assign`: Takes `user_id` (child), `new_chore_id`, `date`. Updates the `dailyBonus` record for that child/date with the `new_chore_id` and sets `is_override = true`. Ensures the `new_chore_id` respects cooldown.
    *   **Acceptance:** Parents can retrieve and update daily bonus chore assignments via these API endpoints.

**Followed by:**

*   **Task P1-T3: Enhance `/api/earn` for Bonus Trigger.**
*   **Task P1-T4: Update `/api/spin-wheel` Logic (thorough verification of all rules).**
*   **Task P1-T5: Implement Good Behavior Spin Trigger in Behavior Modifier API.**

**My Recommendation for "What would you like me to work on next?":**

"Agent, excellent work on the schema and initial storage functions for the Daily Bonus System!

Before we build the frontend wheel, let's ensure the backend logic for bonus *assignment* and *triggering* is complete.

**Please work on this next: Implement the "First Parent Login" middleware to automatically assign daily bonus chores. This should use the `storage.assignDailyBonusChore()` function you've already created. Ensure it assigns one random, eligible (respecting cooldown) bonus chore per child (Bryce and Kiki) per day if one hasn't been assigned yet for that day.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   When a parent user makes an authenticated request, the middleware checks if daily bonuses for Bryce and Kiki for the current date exist.
*   If not, it calls `storage.assignDailyBonusChore()` for each child.
*   The `dailyBonus` table is correctly populated with `trigger_type: 'chore_completion'`.
*   The `chores.last_bonus_assigned` field is updated for the chosen chores.
*   This assignment logic effectively runs only once per day per child.
*   Add relevant unit/integration tests for this middleware and the storage functions it calls."

This will complete a key piece of the automated bonus assignment. After this, we can tackle the parent override APIs, then the chore completion trigger, and finally the spin logic itself, ensuring the backend is fully capable before intensive UI work.
