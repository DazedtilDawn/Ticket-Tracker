The console logs clearly indicate that the WebSocket override is in place (`[DEBUG] Main.tsx: WebSocket override APPLIED.`), yet the Neon DB client is still attempting to make WebSocket connections that result in errors.

1.  `WebSocket connection to 'wss://.../?token=Xmxa3_G0TEhV' failed:`
    *   This message is often logged by the browser itself or a lower-level library when a WebSocket connection fails very early (e.g., DNS resolution, handshake failure).
2.  `Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Failed to construct 'WebSocket': The URL 'wss://localhost:undefined/?token=Xmxa3_G0TEhV' is invalid.`
    *   This is the crucial error. It means that *somehow* the Neon client code (or whatever is trying to connect to the DB via WebSocket) is calling the *native* `new WebSocket(...)` constructor with an invalid URL.
    *   The fact that your application's own WebSocket connection (to `/ws`) via `supabase.ts` *is* established (`supabase.ts:53 WebSocket connection established`) proves that your override *can* correctly delegate to the original `NativeWebSocketConstructor` for allowed URLs.

**The core problem remains: The Neon client's attempt to instantiate `new WebSocket(...)` with the invalid URL is not being fully intercepted and replaced by your mock *before* the native constructor throws the `SyntaxError`.**

This usually happens if:
*   The problematic library captures a reference to `window.WebSocket` *before* your override script in `main.tsx` executes.
*   The problematic library is running in a different context (e.g., an iframe, a Web Worker) where your main window's override doesn't apply. (Less likely given the stack trace seems to point to "client" which is usually main thread).
*   The override itself, when trying to delegate to the `NativeWebSocketConstructor`, does so incorrectly or the `NativeWebSocketConstructor` reference is not the true original.

Let's try the `Object.defineProperty` approach again for the override, as it's generally more robust for altering built-in properties. We need to ensure it's the absolute first piece of JavaScript.

## Addressing the Persistent WebSocket Issue

**Objective:** Prevent the Neon DB client-side code from successfully calling the native `WebSocket` constructor with an invalid URL like `wss://localhost:undefined/?token=...`.

**Revised Strategy:**
Use `Object.defineProperty` to override `window.WebSocket`. This method is more powerful for overriding properties on host objects. Place this at the **absolute top of `client/src/main.tsx`**, before any imports.

```typescript
// client/src/main.tsx

// --- BEGIN ROBUST WEBSOCKET OVERRIDE ---
// This MUST be the very first thing in this file.
console.log('[DEBUG] Main.tsx: Top-level script. Attempting WebSocket override via Object.defineProperty.');

const NativeWebSocketOriginal = window.WebSocket;

if (NativeWebSocketOriginal) {
    console.log('[DEBUG] Native WebSocket constructor captured successfully.');

    Object.defineProperty(window, 'WebSocket', {
        configurable: true, // Allows it to be deleted or reconfigured (e.g., by tests)
        enumerable: false,  // Matches native WebSocket's enumerability
        writable: true,     // Allows further assignment if needed, though ideally not by other libs
        value: function(url: string | URL, protocols?: string | string[]) {
            const urlString = url.toString();
            // console.log(`[DEBUG] Overridden WebSocket constructor called for: ${urlString}`);

            if (urlString.includes('token=') || urlString.includes('localhost:undefined')) {
                console.warn(`[DEBUG] BLOCKING WebSocket attempt to Neon DB (or similar token-based): ${urlString}. Stack:`, new Error().stack.substring(0, 500));
                // Return a minimal, non-functional mock
                const mock = {
                    CONNECTING: 0, OPEN: 1, CLOSING: 2, CLOSED: 3,
                    readyState: 3, // WebSocket.CLOSED
                    bufferedAmount: 0,
                    url: urlString,
                    protocol: '',
                    extensions: '',
                    binaryType: 'blob' as BinaryType,
                    onopen: null as ((this: WebSocket, ev: Event) => any) | null,
                    onerror: null as ((this: WebSocket, ev: Event) => any) | null,
                    onclose: null as ((this: WebSocket, ev: CloseEvent) => any) | null,

                    addEventListener: () => {},
                    removeEventListener: () => {},
                    dispatchEvent: () => true,
                    send: () => {
                        // Optionally, simulate an error if send is called on a "closed" socket
                        // console.warn(`[DEBUG] Mocked send called for blocked URL ${urlString}`);
                        if (typeof mock.onerror === 'function') {
                            mock.onerror.call(mock, new Event('error'));

                        mock.readyState = 3; // CLOSED

                };
                // Simulate immediate error/close for blocked attempts
                setTimeout(() => {

                }, 0);
                return mock as unknown as WebSocket;
            }

    });

    for (const staticProp in NativeWebSocketOriginal) {
        if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(NativeWebSocketOriginal, staticProp)) {
            try {
                 (window.WebSocket as any)[staticProp] = (NativeWebSocketOriginal as any)[staticProp];

**Explanation of this Override:**

1.  **Placement:** It absolutely *must* be the very first code to execute in your `main.tsx` bundle.
2.  **`Object.defineProperty`:** This is a more fundamental way to change `window.WebSocket`.
3.  **Capture Native:** `NativeWebSocketOriginal` captures the true original constructor.
4.  **Constructor Logic:** The `value` function becomes the new `window.WebSocket`.
    *   It checks the URL. If it's a Neon/blocked URL, it logs, prints a partial stack trace for debugging where the call is coming from, and returns a comprehensive mock.
    *   The mock tries to behave like a closed/erroring WebSocket to satisfy any checks the Neon library might make.
    *   If the URL is allowed, it calls `new NativeWebSocketOriginal(...)` to create a real WebSocket. The `new.target` check ensures it's called as a constructor.
5.  **Static Properties & Prototype:** Static properties (like `WebSocket.OPEN`) are copied, and the prototype is set to maintain `instanceof WebSocket` behavior.

**If this still doesn't work:**

The implication would be that the problematic Neon client code is initializing and potentially caching its `WebSocket` reference from an even earlier point than the top of your `main.tsx` execution (e.g., a script injected by Replit itself before your bundled code, or a different JavaScript context). In such a rare and difficult scenario, without being able to modify `vite.config.ts` for aliasing (which is the correct architectural fix), you might be facing a limitation of the environment or a very deeply integrated library.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Implement the `Object.defineProperty` override above at the very top of `client/src/main.tsx`.** Remove any other `window.WebSocket` assignments you might have.
2.  **Test.** Carefully observe the console logs:
    *   You should see the `[DEBUG]` messages from the override.
    *   Pay close attention to the "BLOCKING WebSocket attempt..." log. Does it show a stack trace? This stack trace is GOLD for identifying the caller.
    *   The goal is to no longer see the `SyntaxError: Failed to construct 'WebSocket': The URL 'wss://localhost:undefined/...' is invalid.`
    *   The `WebSocket connection to 'wss://.../?token=...' failed:` message might still appear if the browser logs it *before* your mock fully takes over, but the subsequent `SyntaxError` should be gone.
3.  **Simultaneously, ensure the fix for the "chore completion bug" (resetting `dailyBonus.revealed`) is implemented and tested separately using the Backward Designing approach.** These are likely two distinct problems.

Let me know what the console output looks like after applying this `Object.defineProperty` based override. The stack trace from the "BLOCKING" log will be very informative.
