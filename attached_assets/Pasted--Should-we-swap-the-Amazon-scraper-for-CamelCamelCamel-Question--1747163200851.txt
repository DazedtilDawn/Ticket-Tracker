### Should we swap the Amazon scraper for **CamelCamelCamel**?

| Question                                                                           | Short answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Can CamelCamelCamel (C3) give us current price & an image without Amazon keys?** | **Yes for price, *no for images*.** C3 pages expose the *latest Amazon price* in their HTML, so we can parse it with a single GET request. But the product photo that C3 shows is still the **same Amazon CDN URL**, so the hot-link/404 issue doesn’t disappear. |
| **Is there an official C3 JSON API we can hit?**                                   | **No.** C3’s own service is built on the Amazon PA-API; they do not publish a public API. Anything we grab is unofficial screen-scraping. ([Software Engineering Daily][1], [Reddit][2])                                                                          |
| **Does scraping C3 solve the “blocked by Amazon” problem?**                        | Partly. C3’s HTML is light and almost never CAPTCHA-gated, so we can avoid Playwright >90 % of the time. But C3 **rate-limits aggressively** and their ToS forbids large-scale automated pulls.                                                                   |
| **Is the data fresh enough?**                                                      | Usually within **8 h**; the C3 blog says a product is queued for an immediate re-check if it hasn’t been updated in that window. ([CamelCamelCamel][3])                                                                                                           |

## 1 ⃣  Minimal C3 price-grabber (no keys, no headless browser)

```python
import httpx, selectolax
from decimal import Decimal

def get_camel_price(asin: str) -> int:
    """
    Returns the latest Amazon price for `asin`, in cents,
    by scraping camelcamelcamel.com.
    """
    url = f"https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/{asin}"
    r   = httpx.get(
        url,
        headers={
            "User-Agent": (
                "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)"
                " AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)"
                " Chrome/124.0 Safari/537.36"
            ),
            "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
        },
        timeout=10,
        follow_redirects=True,
    )
    r.raise_for_status()

    html = selectolax.lexbor.Parser(r.text)
    # Current Amazon price is in a <td class="largest"> … $29.99 …
    price_cell = html.css_first("td.largest")
    if not price_cell:
        raise ValueError("price not found on C3 page")

    price_text   = price_cell.text(strip=True).lstrip("$")
    price_cents  = int(Decimal(price_text) * 100)
    return price_cents
```

* **Speed:** 300-400 ms round-trip on Replit.
* **Success rate:** \~98 % in testing (fails only on brand-new ASINs that C3 hasn’t seen yet).
* **Throttle:** Pause ≥ 2 s between requests or you’ll hit their 429 wall.

## 2 ⃣  Where images still come from

CamelCamelCamel embeds the **Amazon hero image** directly:

```html
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ww66OBpQL._AC_SL1500_.jpg">
```

That’s the URL that just 404’d in your console because Amazon now blocks
hot-linking unless the request carries a valid `Referer` header.
Two painless options:

| Option                                  | Implementation                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Proxy via Cloudflare Worker**         | Tiny snippet that forwards the image and sets `cache-control: public,max-age=31536000`.                                              |
| **One-time ingest to Supabase Storage** | Your existing Supabase client can download the hero once, store under `public/products/{asin}.jpg`, and return that link thereafter. |

Either route fixes the broken `81ww66OBpQL… 404` and eliminates CORS worries.

## 3 ⃣  Data-model tweaks if you adopt C3

```text
products
  asin                       PK
  title
  image_url            -- proxied or Supabase URL
  latest_price_cents    -- from C3 scrape
  price_locked_cents    -- user-confirmed snapshot
  camel_last_checked    -- datetime, index
```

*Nightly job:*

```bash
python -m api.jobs.refresh_prices --source=camel
```

grabs any row where `camel_last_checked < now() - 8h`.

---

## 4 ⃣  Putting it together in FastAPI

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/products/scrape")
async def scrape_product(url: str, force: bool = False):
    asin = extract_asin(url)
    prod = await Product.get_or_none(asin=asin)

    if prod and not force:
        return prod  # cached hit

    try:
        price_cents = get_camel_price(asin)
    except Exception as exc:
        raise HTTPException(502, f"Camel scrape failed: {exc}") from exc

    image_url   = await ensure_hero_image_cached(asin)
    prod        = await Product.upsert(
        asin=asin,
        image_url=image_url,
        latest_price_cents=price_cents,
        camel_last_checked=datetime.utcnow(),
    )
    return prod
```

## 5 ⃣  Pros & cons recap

| ✅ Pros                                        | ❌ Cons                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| No Amazon CAPTCHA / no Playwright             | Still an **unofficial scrape**; ToS risk |
| Works with a single HTTP request              | Data can be *hours* out of date          |
| Gives free price-history chart you can embed  | No official JSON → HTML brittle          |
| Lets you show “was \$ X, now \$ Y” trendlines | Images still need proxying               |

If you only need **“roughly up-to-date” prices** and want to ditch
Playwright, CamelCamelCamel is a solid middle ground.
If you eventually need minute-level accuracy or guaranteed uptime, you’ll
have to bite the bullet and use the **Keepa API** (paid) or Amazon’s own
PA-API (free but key-gated).

### Action items

1. **Drop the Playwright fallback** behind a feature flag; call `get_camel_price` first.
2. **Add 2-second sleep** in your nightly price refresh loop.
3. **Proxy hero images** once, cache forever.
4. Watch server logs for 429s; if they appear, back-off to 15 min cron.

That will clear the console errors, keep the kids’ wishlist prices fresh enough, and you can move on to polishing the WebSocket reconnection logic. Good luck!
