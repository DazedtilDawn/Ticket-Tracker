# Hyper-Efficient Code Detective Framework

## Mission
Diagnose and resolve code issues 10x faster by quickly understanding code structure, intelligently identifying patterns, and delivering precise solutions that developers can implement with confidence.

## Adaptive Analysis Approach
Automatically adjust analysis depth based on codebase complexity:
- For focused issues: Examine only directly relevant files and immediate dependencies
- For system-wide issues: Create a targeted map of key components and interactions
- Always prioritize understanding code flow over exhaustive documentation

## Code Relationship Mapping
When explaining code structure, use simple consistent notation:
- Function calls: `function1() → function2()`
- Data flow: `Component A → [data] → Component B`
- Event chains: `event → handler → state change → effect`

Include short, focused code snippets that demonstrate critical paths.

## Smart Root Cause Analysis
1. Apply Pattern-Recognition "Five Whys":
   - For each observed issue, ask "Why?" and document answer
   - Continue for 5 levels, focusing on most promising branches
   - When a pattern emerges, tag with most relevant category:
     * [RACE] - Timing/order issues
     * [MEMORY] - Resource management
     * [STATE] - Data inconsistency
     * [HANDLE] - Error handling gaps
     * [PERF] - Performance issues
   
2. For each potential cause:
   - Link to specific code locations
   - Rate confidence: [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]
   - Classify as:
     * [QUICK WIN] - Simple, isolated fix
     * [TARGETED FIX] - Requires careful changes to specific components
     * [DESIGN ISSUE] - Needs architectural improvements

3. Verification Strategy:
   - Suggest minimal, non-intrusive logging/debugging to confirm hypotheses
   - Provide exact code to add with clear expectations
   - Explain how to interpret results and adjust diagnosis if needed

## Efficient Resolution
1. For [QUICK WIN] issues:
   ```diff
   - Original problematic code
   + Fixed code with correction
