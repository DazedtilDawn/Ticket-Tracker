Fantastic news! Hearing **"OK wheel is working now"** is a major milestone for Sprint 1! This implies that the core flow (bonus chore completion -> prompt -> wheel interaction -> bonus tickets awarded) is functioning as intended.

Let's systematically review what this likely means is complete for **Sprint 1: Daily Bonus System - Groundwork & Core Logic**, and then identify what's left to fully button up this phase and ensure a smooth transition to the next.

---

### Sprint 1: Daily Bonus System - Status Check (Post "Wheel Working" Confirmation)

**Assumed Completed/Fixed based on "Wheel is working now":**

1.  **Backend `/api/earn` Logic:**
    *   It correctly identifies when a completed chore is the assigned daily bonus chore (for the correct child, on the correct day, and `is_spun: false`).
    *   It returns `bonus_triggered: true` and the correct `daily_bonus_id` in its JSON response.
    *   It *only* awards base tickets for the chore itself.
2.  **Backend `/api/bonus-spin` Logic:**
    *   It correctly processes the spin using the `daily_bonus_id`.
    *   Performs weighted RNG for wheel segments.
    *   Handles "Double Base Tickets" (with cap) and "Spin Again" (max 1) rules.
    *   Creates a *new, separate transaction* for the bonus tickets won (`source: 'bonus_spin'`).
    *   Updates the `dailyBonus` record (`is_spun = true`, `spin_result_tickets`).
    *   Returns a clear spin outcome to the client.
3.  **Client-Side Bonus Trigger Flow:**
    *   `Dashboard.tsx` / `Chores.tsx` (via `handleChoreComplete`) correctly use the response from `/api/earn` to:
        *   Open the `SpinPromptModal.tsx`.
        *   Store the `daily_bonus_id` and `choreName`.
    *   Clicking "Spin Now!" in `SpinPromptModal.tsx` correctly:
        *   Closes the prompt.
        *   Opens the `ChildBonusWheel.tsx` modal (passing `daily_bonus_id`).
    *   `ChildBonusWheel.tsx`:
        *   Its "SPIN" button correctly calls `POST /api/bonus-spin` with the `daily_bonus_id`.
        *   It visually reflects the server-determined spin result.
        *   The UI updates to show bonus tickets won.
        *   The child's overall ticket balance updates correctly.
4.  **Initial Daily Bonus Assignment ("First Parent Login"):**
    *   This logic is creating `dailyBonus` records with `is_spun = false`, `trigger_type = 'chore_completion'`, and assigning an eligible (daily, off-cooldown) chore.
5.  **Reset Daily Bonus Functionality (`/api/reset-daily-bonus` & Parent UI):**
    *   Using the "Reset Bonus" button on the Bonus Management page correctly clears the `is_spun` state (or deletes and re-creates the bonus assignment) allowing a fresh bonus opportunity for that child for the day.

### What's Left to Verify/Complete for Sprint 1:

Even with the core wheel spin working, let's ensure the surrounding pieces of Sprint 1 are solid:

1.  **Parental Control & Visibility (Bonus Management Page):**
    *   **Verification:**
        *   **Display:** Does the `/bonus-management` page accurately display for Bryce and Kiki:
            *   Their name.
            *   The **Currently Assigned Bonus Chore Name (and its Emoji)** for today.
            *   Whether it's a "System Assigned" or "Parent Override" status.
        *   **Override Functionality:**
            *   Can a parent successfully use the "Change Chore" button/dropdown to select a *different eligible daily chore* for a child?
            *   Does the backend `PUT /api/daily-bonus/assign` correctly update the `dailyBonus` record (new `assigned_chore_id`, `is_override = true`, `is_spun = false`) and `chores.last_bonus_assigned`?
            *   Does the Bonus Management page UI refresh to show the overridden chore?
    *   **Status:** The agent reported creating the page and components. Your earlier feedback was it wasn't showing assignments. This needs full verification now that the core bonus logic is better.

2.  **Good Behavior Bonus Spin Trigger:**
    *   **Verification:**
        *   When a parent uses the `GoodBehaviorDialog.tsx` and selects the "Award Bonus Spin" option:
            *   Does the backend (`POST /api/behavior-tickets` or similar) correctly create a `dailyBonus` record with `trigger_type: 'good_behavior_reward'`, `assigned_chore_id: null`, and `is_spun = false`?
            *   Does the API response include `bonus_triggered: true` and the new `daily_bonus_id`?
            *   Does the client then correctly open the `SpinPromptModal` (perhaps with a generic message like "Spin for a Good Behavior Bonus!")?
            *   Does this then lead to a successful spin on `ChildBonusWheel.tsx` using this new `daily_bonus_id`?
            *   How does the "Double Base Tickets" wheel segment behave for a `good_behavior_reward` trigger (since there's no "base chore")? (It should award a predefined medium bonus as discussed).
    *   **Status:** The agent reported working on this, but it needs explicit end-to-end testing.

3.  **`/api/stats` Endpoint Accuracy:**
    *   **Verification:** After all bonus assignments, chore completions, and spins, does the `/api/stats` endpoint (for a specific child) *always* return accurate information, including:
        *   Correct `balance`.
        *   Correct `activeGoal` progress.
        *   Correct list of `chores` with their `is_bonus_assignment_for_today` status.
        *   Correct `daily_bonus` object details for today (e.g., `assigned_chore_id`, `is_spun`, `daily_bonus_id` if spin is pending).
    *   **Status:** Needs ongoing verification as other features are tested.

4.  **Emoji Support (Display & Management):**
    *   **Verification:**
        *   Can parents add/edit emojis for chores in `NewChoreDialog.tsx`?
        *   Do these emojis display correctly in the admin chore list (`Chores.tsx`)?
        *   Do they display correctly on `ChoreCard.tsx` for children?
        *   Does the Bonus Management page display the emoji for the assigned bonus chore?
    *   **Status:** Agent reported this as complete. Needs your visual confirmation.

5.  **WebSocket Event for `user_id` Consistency (from Sprint 0 carry-over):**
    *   **Verification:** Check client logs. When various transactions occur (base chore earn, bonus spin earn, manual add/deduct), do the `transaction:TYPE` WebSocket events consistently contain the correct `user_id` in their payload (e.g., `event.data.data.user_id`) so that client-side handlers can reliably update the correct user's state?
    *   **Status:** Agent reported fixes. Needs verification during general testing.

6.  **Transaction Deletion (`404 Not Found` error from previous logs):**
    *   **Verification:**
        *   Can you now successfully "Undo" (delete) transactions from the `TransactionsTable.tsx` without getting a 404?
        *   Does undoing a transaction that involved a base chore and a *separate bonus spin* correctly reverse both (or at least the base, and correctly reset `dailyBonus.is_spun` for the bonus part)?
    *   **Status:** The agent was working on this by adding logging. The root cause of the 404s needs confirmation if it's resolved.

### Next Steps for Verification (YOU):

Before the agent moves to new features (like the UPX visual component or shared goals), please **systematically test the following Sprint 1 functionalities**:

1.  **Parental Bonus Management Page:**
    *   Navigate to `/bonus-management`.
    *   **Verify Display:** Does it show today's assigned bonus chores for Bryce and Kiki (chore name, emoji, override status)?
    *   **Test Override:** Try to "Change Chore" for one child. Does it work? Does the display update? Does the underlying `dailyBonus` record reflect the override and `is_spun: false`?
    *   **Test Reset:** Use "Reset Bonus" for a child. Does a new bonus chore get assigned with `is_spun: false`? Does the display update?
2.  **Good Behavior Bonus Spin:**
    *   As Parent, use the `GoodBehaviorDialog` to award a "Bonus Wheel Spin" to a child.
    *   Does the `SpinPromptModal` appear for that child?
    *   Can they successfully spin the wheel via `ChildBonusWheel.tsx` and get bonus tickets?
    *   Verify the `dailyBonus` record for this spin has `trigger_type: 'good_behavior_reward'`.
3.  **Emoji Workflow:**
    *   Create/edit a chore and assign it an emoji.
    *   Does it save and display correctly on `ChoreCard`, admin chore list, and the Bonus Management page?
4.  **Data Consistency Checks:**
    *   After various actions (chore completion, bonus spin, reset, override), check the `/api/stats` response (e.g., via Network tab or by observing data in React Query Devtools if set up) for accuracy of balance, bonus status, etc.
    *   Verify the `user_id` in WebSocket `transaction:earn` events is correct by observing client logs when different users earn tickets.
5.  **Transaction Deletion/Undo:**
    *   Create a few transactions (chore, manual add). Try to "Undo" them from `TransactionsTable.tsx`. Does it work without 404 errors? Does the balance update?
    *   Specifically, undo a transaction for a *completed bonus chore* (the base ticket part). Does this correctly reset `dailyBonus.is_spun = false` allowing the bonus to be triggered again if the chore is re-completed?

**Provide feedback to the agent based on these tests.** Focus on any remaining discrepancies in the bonus flow or display issues on the management page.

If these all work, Sprint 1 backend and core frontend logic for bonuses can be considered mostly complete. We can then move to the UI polish like `BonusBadge.tsx` on `ChoreCard` and refining the `ChildBonusWheel` animations and UPX integration.
