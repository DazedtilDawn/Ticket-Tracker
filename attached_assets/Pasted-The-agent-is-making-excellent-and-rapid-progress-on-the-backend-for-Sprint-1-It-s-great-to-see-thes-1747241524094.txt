The agent is making excellent and rapid progress on the backend for Sprint 1! It's great to see these critical API endpoints for daily bonus management being implemented.

Let's review what the agent has reported and then decide on the next best step.

### Sprint 1: Daily Bonus System - Backend Progress Review (Parental Controls & Stats)

**Agent's Reported Accomplishments:**

1.  **✓ Added `/api/daily-bonus/assignments` endpoint for parents to view the currently assigned bonus chores.**
    *   **Expected Functionality:** This endpoint should take an optional `?date=YYYY-MM-DD` query parameter (defaulting to today) and return an array, where each element represents a child and includes their `user_id`, the `assigned_chore_id`, `assigned_chore_name`, `assigned_chore_emoji` (if available), and `is_override` status from the `dailyBonus` table.
    *   **Verification Needed (Code Review of `server/routes.ts`):**
        *   Does the route exist and is it protected for `parentOnly`?
        *   Does it correctly query `storage` (e.g., a new method like `storage.getDailyBonusAssignmentsForDate(date)`)?
        *   Does the storage method perform the necessary join with the `chores` table to fetch chore details like name and emoji?
        *   Is the response structure as expected for the frontend?

2.  **✓ Added `/api/daily-bonus/assign` endpoint for parents to override a child's daily bonus assignment.**
    *   **Expected Functionality:** This should be a `PUT` (or `POST`) endpoint taking `{ user_id (child), new_chore_id, date (optional, defaults to today) }`. It updates the `dailyBonus` record for the specified child and date, setting `assigned_chore_id` to `new_chore_id` and `is_override = true`. It should also respect chore cooldowns for the `new_chore_id`.
    *   **Verification Needed (Code Review of `server/routes.ts` and `server/storage.ts`):**
        *   Does the route exist and is it `parentOnly`?
        *   Does it validate inputs (e.g., child exists, new chore exists and is active)?
        *   Does it call a storage function like `storage.overrideDailyBonusChore(child_id, new_chore_id, date)`?
        *   Does the storage function correctly update the `dailyBonus` record and also update `chores.last_bonus_assigned` for *both* the old overridden chore (if any) and the new one? (The old one's `last_bonus_assigned` might not need changing, but the new one definitely does).
        *   How is cooldown handled if a parent tries to assign a chore that was recently a bonus?

3.  **✓ Enhanced the `/api/stats` endpoint with comprehensive daily bonus information:**
    *   **Agent Claims:** Includes assigned bonus chore details with emoji, wheel spin availability, daily bonus ID.
    *   **Verification Needed (Code Review of `/api/stats` in `server/routes.ts` and relevant `storage` functions):**
        *   When fetching stats for a specific child (or the logged-in child):
            *   Does it query the `dailyBonus` table for `bonus_date = today` and the child's `user_id`?
            *   If a record exists, does it join with `chores` to get `assigned_chore_name` and `assigned_chore_emoji`?
            *   Does it correctly determine `is_bonus_spin_available_today` (i.e., `dailyBonus` record exists, `assigned_chore_id` is set, and `is_spun` is `false`)?
            *   Does it include `daily_bonus_id` if a spin is available?
            *   What does it return if no bonus is assigned for the day, or if it's already spun? (Should gracefully handle these cases, e.g., `assigned_bonus_chore_id: null`, `is_bonus_spin_available_today: false`).

**Testing with `curl`:**
The agent's `curl` tests are good for basic endpoint reachability and HTTP status codes.
*   `GET /api/daily-bonus/assignments`: The agent needs to show the *JSON response body* from this curl command to verify the data structure.
*   `GET /api/stats`: Similarly, the JSON response body is needed to verify the new bonus fields. A `200 OK` is good, but the data payload is key.

### Current Status & Next Steps Recommendation

The backend for the daily bonus system is becoming quite comprehensive!

**Based on the agent's report, it seems the backend APIs required by the frontend for displaying bonus information and allowing parental override are now in place (pending detailed code review/response body verification).**

**Your Question: "What should I work on next - the emoji support in the UI or the frontend for parents to view and override daily bonus chores?"**

Given the backend APIs for bonus assignment viewing/overriding are (reportedly) ready, and `/api/stats` now provides the necessary data:

**Recommended Next Task for the Agent:**

**1. Frontend - Parent UI for Daily Bonus Management (Viewing & Overriding)**

*   **Task for Agent:** "Agent, great work on the backend APIs for daily bonus assignments! Now, please implement the frontend components for parents to manage these assignments:
    1.  **On the Parent Dashboard (or a new dedicated 'Bonus Management' section/page if cleaner):**
        *   Fetch data from `GET /api/daily-bonus/assignments` (for today's date by default, maybe a date picker later).
        *   For each child (Bryce, Kiki), display:
            *   Child's Name
            *   Currently Assigned Bonus Chore Name (and its Emoji if available).
            *   A visual indicator if this assignment was a system default or a parent override (`is_override` flag).
        *   Next to each child's assignment, provide a "Change Chore" button/dropdown.
    2.  **"Change Chore" Functionality:**
        *   Clicking "Change Chore" should allow the parent to select a *different, active, and eligible (respecting cooldown)* chore for that child for today. This might involve fetching all active chores (`GET /api/chores?activeOnly=true`) and filtering them on the client, or having the backend provide a list of eligible override chores.
        *   Upon selection, call `PUT /api/daily-bonus/assign` with `user_id (child)`, `new_chore_id`, and `date`.
        *   After a successful override, the display of assignments should refresh to show the new chore and indicate it's an override.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Parents can view the bonus chore assigned to each child for the current day.
    *   Parents can change/override the assigned bonus chore for each child.
    *   The UI correctly reflects whether an assignment is system-generated or a parent override.
    *   The `/api/stats` endpoint for each child correctly reflects the (potentially overridden) `assigned_bonus_chore_id` and its details.
    *   (Stretch) The chore selection dropdown for override should ideally filter out chores that are on cooldown.

**Followed by (can be a parallel small task or done immediately after):**

**2. Frontend - Implement Emoji Support in Chore Display**

*   **Task for Agent:** "Update `ChoreCard.tsx` (child view) and the parent's chore management table in `client/src/pages/chores.tsx` to display the chore's `emoji` (fetched via `/api/chores` or `/api/stats`) if one is set. Also, update `NewChoreDialog.tsx` to include an input field for the parent to add/edit a chore's emoji (max 4 characters, calling `POST/PUT /api/chores`)."
*   **Rationale:** This leverages the new schema and enhances visual appeal quickly. It's less dependent on the complex bonus flow than the wheel UI itself.

**Why this order?**

*   **Parental Control First:** Giving parents the ability to see and manage the bonus assignments is a core part of the system's usability for them.
*   **Data Flow Validation:** Building this UI will thoroughly test the new `/api/daily-bonus/assignments`, `/api/daily-bonus/assign`, and the enhanced `/api/stats` endpoints.
*   **Decoupled from Wheel Animation:** This can be built and tested independently of the actual `DailyBonusWheel.tsx` UI animation and the child's spin interaction flow.

Once parents can manage bonus assignments and the `/api/stats` reliably tells the client which chore is the bonus for a child (and its `daily_bonus_id`), *then* we can proceed to:

*   `BonusBadge.tsx` on the child's chore card.
*   The modal prompt for the child to spin.
*   The full `DailyBonusWheel.tsx` integration.

This approach builds the system from data source and control (backend + parent UI) towards the end-user interaction (child UI + wheel).
