# Building the Ticket Tracker Android App

This guide walks through the process of converting your Ticket Tracker web application into a fully functional Android app.

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio (latest version)
- JDK 11 or newer
- Your Ticket Tracker web app deployed to a publicly accessible URL

## Two Approaches

You can choose between two approaches to bring your app to Android:

### Option 1: Progressive Web App (PWA)

The simplest approach is to use the PWA features we've already implemented:

1. Deploy your Replit app to a public URL
2. Open Chrome on Android and navigate to your app URL
3. Tap the menu button and select "Add to Home Screen"
4. Choose a name for the app icon and confirm

**Advantages:**

- No extra development needed
- App updates automatically when you update the web version
- Works on all Android devices with Chrome

**Limitations:**

- Less integrated with the Android system
- Can't use advanced Android features

### Option 2: WebView Wrapper (Full Android App)

For a more native experience, use the WebView wrapper we've created:

1. Create a new Android Studio project
2. Copy files from the `/public/android` folder into your project
3. Update the `baseUrl` in `MainActivity.java` to your deployed app URL
4. Build and sign the app for distribution

## Step-by-Step Instructions for WebView Wrapper

### 1. Create a New Android Project

1. Open Android Studio
2. Click "New Project" and select "Empty Activity"
3. Set the following:
   - Name: "Ticket Tracker"
   - Package name: "com.tickettracker.app"
   - Language: Java
   - Minimum SDK: API 21 (Android 5.0)
4. Click "Finish"

### 2. Copy the Files

Copy these files to your Android project:

- `MainActivity.java` → `app/src/main/java/com/tickettracker/app/`
- `SplashActivity.java` → `app/src/main/java/com/tickettracker/app/`
- `activity_main.xml` → `app/src/main/res/layout/`
- `activity_splash.xml` → `app/src/main/res/layout/`
- `splash_background.xml` → `app/src/main/res/drawable/`

### 3. Update AndroidManifest.xml

Replace the contents of your `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` with the contents of our `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

### 4. Configure App Icons

1. In Android Studio, right-click the `res` folder
2. Select "New" → "Image Asset"
3. Choose "Launcher Icons (Adaptive and Legacy)"
4. Import our SVG icon from `/public/icons/icon-192x192.svg`
5. Customize colors if desired
6. Click "Next" and "Finish"

### 5. Update Your App URL

In `MainActivity.java`, find:

```java
private String baseUrl = "https://your-replit-app-url.replit.app";
```

Replace with your actual deployed app URL.

### 6. Build and Test

1. Connect an Android device or use the emulator
2. Click "Run" to build and install the app
3. Test all functionality

## Distribution

When you're ready to distribute your app:

1. In Android Studio, select "Build" → "Generate Signed Bundle / APK"
2. Follow the prompts to create a signing key if you don't have one
3. Share the APK file or publish to Google Play Store

## Additional Features to Consider

- **Push Notifications**: Replace our notification code with Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Offline Support**: Enhance the service worker for better offline functionality
- **Biometric Authentication**: Add fingerprint/face login support
- **Deep Linking**: Configure your app to handle custom URLs

## Troubleshooting

- **White Screen**: Check that your baseUrl is correct and accessible
- **Slow Performance**: Enable hardware acceleration in AndroidManifest.xml
- **CORS Issues**: Your backend must allow requests from the Android WebView
