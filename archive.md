## Multi-Parent Support & Refresh Token Authentication (Completed: June 9, 2025)

### Overview
Implemented comprehensive multi-parent support and persistent authentication using refresh tokens with HttpOnly cookies.

### Completed Steps:

#### 1. **Database Schema Updates**
- ✅ Created `family_parents` join table with composite primary key
- ✅ Added `performed_by_id` column to transactions table for audit trail
- ✅ Imported `primaryKey` from drizzle-orm/pg-core
- ✅ Created migration file `0019_multi_parent_auth.sql`
- ✅ Created migration file `0020_rename_delta_tickets.sql` to fix column naming

#### 2. **Authentication System Refactor**
- ✅ Implemented dual token system (access token + refresh token)
- ✅ Access tokens: 15 minute expiry, stored in memory
- ✅ Refresh tokens: 14-28 day expiry, stored in HttpOnly cookies
- ✅ Added cookie-parser dependency
- ✅ Created token refresh middleware and helper functions

#### 3. **API Endpoints**
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh access token endpoint
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/logout` - Clear refresh token cookie
- ✅ `POST /api/families/:id/invite-parent` - Invite parent to family
- ✅ `GET /api/families/:id/parents` - List all parents in family
- ✅ `GET /api/me` - Get current user info
- ✅ Updated all transaction endpoints to track `performed_by_id`

#### 4. **Frontend Token Management**
- ✅ Updated `apiRequest()` to handle 401 responses automatically
- ✅ Implemented refresh token queue to prevent race conditions
- ✅ Updated query functions to support automatic token refresh
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript type narrowing issues with type assertions

#### 5. **Test Suite**
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite for multi-parent features
- ✅ Updated existing tests to work with new authentication flow
- ✅ Fixed test database migration order issues
- ✅ All tests passing with real database

#### 6. **Documentation**
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with all new features and patterns
- ✅ Added troubleshooting guide for common issues
- ✅ Documented API response formats and common patterns

### Technical Details:

#### Family Parents Table Structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "family_parents" (
  "family_id" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "families"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  "parent_id" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "users"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  "role" text DEFAULT 'parent' NOT NULL,
  "added_at" timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY ("family_id", "parent_id")
);
```

#### Refresh Token Cookie Configuration:
```typescript
{
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  sameSite: 'strict',
  maxAge: rememberMe ? 28 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 : 14 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
  path: '/',
}
```

### Files Modified:
- `shared/schema.ts` - Added family_parents table and performed_by_id
- `server/lib/auth.ts` - Refactored for dual token system
- `server/routes.ts` - Added new endpoints and updated existing ones
- `server/index.ts` - Added cookie parser middleware
- `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` - Added automatic token refresh
- `migrations/0019_multi_parent_auth.sql` - Multi-parent schema changes
- `migrations/0020_rename_delta_tickets.sql` - Column rename fixes
- `server/__tests__/multi-parent.test.ts` - New test suite
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated documentation

### Known Issues Addressed:
1. Fixed missing primaryKey import from drizzle-orm
2. Resolved cookie-parser dependency issue
3. Fixed database migration order problems
4. Resolved TypeScript literal type narrowing with type assertions
5. Fixed column name mismatches (delta_tickets → delta, date → created_at)

### Next Steps (Suggested):
- Update Vite proxy configuration to use port 5001 instead of 5000
- Consider implementing role-based permissions for family parents
- Add UI for managing family parent invitations
- Implement email notifications for parent invitations
