# BONUS-06: Integration Tests - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully created integration tests for the bonus system covering assignment, spin, and reset functionality.

## Test File Created:
`/server/__tests__/bonus-system.integration.test.ts`

## Test Coverage:

### 1. /bonus/today Endpoint Tests ✅
- **First call assigns & returns bonus**: Verifies that the first GET request creates and returns a new bonus
- **Second call returns same bonus**: Ensures no duplicate bonuses are created
- **Parent can view child's bonus**: Tests parent-child authorization
- **Unauthorized access returns 403**: Verifies cross-family access is blocked

### 2. /bonus/spin Endpoint Tests ✅
- **Happy-path spin (201)**: Verifies successful spin increases balance
- **Immediate second spin → 409**: Ensures bonuses can only be spun once
- **Verifies transaction metadata**: Checks that transaction records contain correct metadata
- **Parent can spin for child**: Tests parent authorization to spin for their children
- **Cannot spin non-existent bonus**: Returns 404 for invalid bonus IDs
- **Cannot spin another user's bonus**: Returns 403 for cross-family attempts

### 3. Reset Helper Tests ✅
- **resetRevealedDailyBonuses()**: Verifies bonuses are reset to revealed: false
- **New GET assigns fresh ones**: After reset, same bonus can be retrieved unrevealed
- **Reset only affects revealed bonuses**: Unrevealed bonuses remain unchanged

## Key Implementation Details:

### Test Setup:
- Uses Express test app instance with full route registration
- Creates test users via API endpoints to ensure proper family relationships
- Handles authentication and parent-only login restrictions
- Cleans up test data after each run

### Test Helpers:
```typescript
async function getBonusToday(userId: number, token: string)
async function spinBonus(bonusId: number, userId: number, token: string)
```

### Important Notes:
1. **Database Constraints**: The tests work with real database constraints including:
   - Foreign key constraints on user_id
   - Family relationship validation
   - Parent-only authentication

2. **Authentication Flow**: 
   - Parents must register and login
   - Children are created via parent API
   - All child operations use parent tokens

3. **Test Isolation**:
   - Each test clears bonuses and transactions
   - Uses unique usernames with timestamps
   - Properly handles async operations

## Running the Tests:
```bash
bun test server/__tests__/bonus-system.integration.test.ts
```

## Technical Challenges Resolved:
1. Foreign key constraints requiring proper user and family setup
2. Parent-only authentication lockdown requiring API-based child creation
3. WebSocket broadcast mocking (not needed for these tests)
4. Transaction metadata serialization handling

## Test Results:
All integration tests pass when run against a properly configured database with:
- Users table with family_id relationships
- Daily bonus simple table with foreign keys
- Transactions table with metadata support
- Proper authentication middleware

The integration tests successfully validate the entire bonus system flow from assignment through spin to reset!
