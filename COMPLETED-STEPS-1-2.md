# Completed Steps 1 & 2 - Summary

## Step 1: Child-profile API & migrations ✅

All functionality already existed in the codebase:

1. **Database columns** - `is_archived` and `banner_color_preference` already in schema
2. **Storage helpers** - All CRUD operations implemented:
   - `createChildForParent()` 
   - `updateChildForParent()`
   - `archiveChildForParent()`
   - `deleteChildForParent()`
3. **API Routes** - All endpoints implemented:
   - `POST /api/family/children`
   - `PUT /api/family/children/:id`
   - `PATCH /api/family/children/:id/archive`
   - `DELETE /api/family/children/:id`
4. **Banner color auto-assignment** - Randomly selects from predefined gradients
5. **Integration tests** - Full test coverage in multiple test files

## Step 2: Chore-completion pipeline ✅

Most functionality already existed, with one small addition:

1. **Updated /api/earn** - Added `storage.logChoreCompletion()` call to track completions
2. **GET /api/chores** - Already returns `completed` boolean when userId provided
3. **Cron job** - Already implemented in `server/jobs/resetChores.ts`:
   - Runs at 00:05 daily
   - Deletes completions based on recurrence (daily=1d, weekly=7d, monthly=31d)
4. **Unit tests** - Comprehensive tests in `chore-reset.test.ts`

## Key Changes Made:

1. Added chore completion logging to `/api/earn` endpoint:
```typescript
// Log chore completion for tracking
await storage.logChoreCompletion(chore_id, user.id);
```

2. Removed hard-coded "Bryce/Kiki" filters (from previous UIUX-02 task)

## Ready for Next Steps:

The codebase is now ready for:
- Step 3: Single-balance goal logic
- Step 4: Bonus system polish
- Step 5: Clean-up items

All database tables, storage functions, and API endpoints are in place and tested.
