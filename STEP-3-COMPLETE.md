# Step 3: Single-Balance Goal Logic - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented the single-balance goal logic, eliminating the `tickets_saved` field and using the user's balance as the single source of truth for goal progress.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Server-Side Changes
- **Progress Calculation**: The `/api/stats` endpoint already calculates progress from balance using `calculateGoalProgressFromBalance()` (server/routes.ts:3667-3672)
- **Over-saved Tickets**: The endpoint calculates and returns `overSavedTickets` when balance exceeds the product price (server/routes.ts:3780-3783)
- **Backward Compatibility**: The endpoint sets `tickets_saved: balance` for backward compatibility (server/routes.ts:3777)
- **Purchase Endpoint**: The `/api/goals/:id/purchase` endpoint (server/routes.ts:1895-1981):
  - Validates user has sufficient balance (≥100% progress)
  - Creates a spend transaction for the exact ticket amount needed
  - Marks the goal as purchased
  - Broadcasts a WebSocket event `goal:purchased`
  - Returns the remaining balance

### 2. Client-Side Changes
- **ProgressCard Component**: Already displays progress based on the server-calculated values
  - Shows progress percentage, over-saved tickets, and purchase button
  - Handles milestone celebrations at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%
  - Purchase button appears when progress ≥ 100%
- **WebSocket Event Handling**: Added handler for `goal:purchased` event in new-dashboard.tsx:
  - Shows success toast notification
  - Updates balance in cache
  - Refreshes relevant queries (stats, transactions, goals)
  - Properly cleans up WebSocket subscriptions

### 3. Business Logic Functions
All necessary functions were already implemented in `server/lib/business-logic.ts`:
- `getCurrentProductPrice()`: Returns live product price
- `calculateGoalProgressFromBalance()`: Calculates progress from balance
- `calculateOverSavedTickets()`: Calculates tickets beyond goal requirement
- `ticketsNeededFor()`: Calculates tickets needed for a price

### 4. Tests
Comprehensive test coverage exists in `server/__tests__/purchase-goal.test.ts`:
- ✅ Purchase with exactly 100% progress
- ✅ Rejection when balance < 100%
- ✅ Over-saved scenario handling
- ✅ Rejection of already purchased goals
- ✅ Rejection of inactive goals
- ✅ Ticket calculation for various prices
- ✅ Price change handling

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Single Source of Truth**: User balance is the only source for goal progress
2. **No Migration Needed**: The `tickets_saved` field remains for backward compatibility but is not used
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket events ensure UI updates immediately after purchase
4. **Exact Spending**: Only the exact tickets needed are spent, preserving any over-saved amount

## API Behavior

### GET /api/stats
Returns:
```json
{
  "balance": 120,
  "activeGoal": {
    "id": 1,
    "tickets_saved": 120, // For backward compatibility
    "progress": 120, // Calculated as (balance / price) * 100
    "overSavedTickets": 20, // If balance > price
    "product": {
      "price_cents": 2500 // Current live price
    }
  }
}
```

### POST /api/goals/:id/purchase
- Validates balance ≥ tickets needed
- Creates spend transaction
- Marks goal as purchased
- Returns remaining balance
- Broadcasts `goal:purchased` WebSocket event

## Summary
Step 3 is complete. The application now uses a single-balance approach for goal progress, with proper purchase flow, WebSocket updates, and comprehensive test coverage. The system correctly handles over-saved scenarios and maintains backward compatibility.
